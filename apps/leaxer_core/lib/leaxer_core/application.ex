defmodule LeaxerCore.Application do
  @moduledoc """
  Main OTP application module for LeaxerCore.

  ## Supervision Tree

  Uses `:one_for_one` strategy - if a child process terminates, only that process
  is restarted. This is appropriate because most services are independent.

  ### Process Start Order and Dependencies

  Children are started in order; later processes may depend on earlier ones:

  1. **LeaxerCoreWeb.Telemetry** - Metrics collection (independent)
  2. **DNSCluster** - DNS-based clustering (independent)
  3. **Phoenix.PubSub** - Message broadcasting backbone (required by most services)
  4. **LeaxerCore.LogBroadcaster** - Log streaming (depends on PubSub)
  5. **LeaxerCore.Nodes.Registry** - Node type registry via ETS (required by Runtime)
  6. **LeaxerCore.Models.Registry** - Model metadata cache (independent)
  7. **Task.Supervisor** - Async task execution (used by DownloadManager)
  8. **Finch** - HTTP client pool (used by DownloadManager)
  9. **LeaxerCore.Models.DownloadManager** - Model downloads (depends on Finch, PubSub)
  10. **LeaxerCore.HardwareMonitor** - System metrics (depends on PubSub)
  11. **LeaxerCore.Workers.ProcessTracker** - Orphaned process cleanup (independent)
  12. **LeaxerCore.ExecutionState** - Execution progress via ETS (independent)
  13. **LeaxerCore.Queue** - Job queue manager (depends on PubSub, Runtime)
  14. **LeaxerCore.Workers.StableDiffusion** - CLI-based image generation (depends on ProcessTracker)
  15. **LeaxerCore.Workers.StableDiffusionServer** - Singleton HTTP server mode (keeps model in VRAM)
  16. **LeaxerCore.Workers.LLM** - Text generation via llama.cpp (depends on ProcessTracker)
  17. **LeaxerCoreWeb.Endpoint** - Phoenix HTTP/WebSocket server (depends on PubSub)

  ### Restart Behavior

  With `:one_for_one`, each process restarts independently:

  - **ETS-backed services** (Registry, ExecutionState, Queue): State survives restarts
    since ETS tables are owned by the supervisor, not the GenServer.
  - **Stateless workers** (StableDiffusion, LLM): Clean restart, any in-flight job fails.
  - **External process managers** (StableDiffusion, LLM, StableDiffusionServer):
    On crash, ProcessTracker detects via monitor and kills orphaned OS processes.
  - **StableDiffusionServer**: Singleton HTTP server that keeps model in VRAM. On crash,
    ProcessTracker kills orphaned sd-server process; model reloads on next request.

  ### Failure Scenarios

  | Process Crash | Impact | Recovery |
  |--------------|--------|----------|
  | PubSub | All real-time updates stop | Auto-restart, clients reconnect |
  | Nodes.Registry | Node lookups fail | Auto-restart, ETS persists |
  | Queue | Job processing stops | Auto-restart, ETS state preserved |
  | StableDiffusion | Current generation fails | Auto-restart, ProcessTracker kills orphan |
  | ProcessTracker | Orphan detection stops | Auto-restart, re-scans for orphans |
  | Endpoint | All HTTP/WS connections drop | Auto-restart, clients reconnect |
